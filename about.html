<p>After studying several different creative disciplines & many years of administrative work I decided to take the leap into data science. I've worked with data throughout my career and studied statistics in HS & college, but I'm a newbie at all things python, machine learning, & big data. Flatiron School was my school of choice to learn these things. Every story has to start somewhere.</p>

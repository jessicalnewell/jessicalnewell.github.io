In short, I'm interested in learning how to apply data science to create richer customer experiences for micro businesses.

It's obvious we are all swimming in an ocean of data every day and creative entrepreneurs are likely sitting on mountains of it that they can use to better serve their customers, if only they could navigate it and pull out the gems of insight that would speak straight to their customer's hearts. This returns a happier customer and a more profitable business.

What leads me here?

It all started when I built a blog about interior styling and home organization. While I had studied interior design and wanted to create my own business once I launched the website, I found myself becoming way more interested in the actual building of and marketing the blog.

This lead to gaining skills in Wordpress site management, HTML, CSS, graphic design, photography, prop styling and brand management.  Not the typical route to the title of 'data scientist', this I know. So where did the shift come in?

Honestly, I tried to start a few different businesses and kept getting stuck. How do I actually know what potential customers actually want? In learning about online marketing I learned the concept of the 'ideal customer avatar' but trying to just dream this person up with no research was not working. So I decided, aha - studying user experience design was where it was at. I needed to learn how to conduct customer research, engage in user testing and apply what I find to the customer experience.

There was just one little problem. How do I turn the raw data from the research and testing into something meaningful that I could actually use?

Well, that's exactly what I'm trying to figure out. 

And finally, after this roundabout journey to embarking into data science, I am finally ready to get to work. Actually, the journey is just getting started.

If I can figure out how to make data work for my own creative micro-business (yet to be revealed), I can also help others like me create the most successful businesses possible that allow them to build their profits by serving their customers well.

One thing I do know, I'm uniquely prepared for this discipline because of my idiosyncratic background and not in spite of it. I had a gut feeling I was but also have had doubts about my abilities and experience. 

Then I watched this video and it made me consider that my hypothesis just might be correct.

There are a lot of peripheral reasons why I embarked on this program. It would be a long list of all the ways I want to and should prove myself to others, get that in demand AI job and make a lot of money. But those reasons were just never enough for me. I have very high expectations ;)

I'm actually doing this on purpose. There's a real, thoughtfully-considered reason I signed up for this course. It was not on a whim.

Simply put, I have a concept for personal development application that will require a thorough understanding of how to work with data to provide feedback on improving performance in life-supporting habits, thought patterns, and decisions.

It is truly terrifying to share this with the world (and I've majorly procrastinated & fallen into self-sabotage in resistance to putting it out there), but as someone who works daily to overcome potentially debilitating mental health hurdles so that I can not only survive in this world, but thrive and make a positive impact on others, I have a strong interest in understanding why we do the things we do, make the decisions we make, and how we can all do better.

Because this life we've been given is too short. And it's more than worth it to put our blood, sweat, and tears into. No matter how hard it gets.

I believe that grace is always there for us and failing is the only road to success.

But if we really want things to change we have to challenge ourselves, measure our feedback and iterate on the choices we make and the chances we take, big or small.

It's the only way to grow and life is the best experiment we have at our disposal to encompass that growth. 

Data science in and of itself is a primarily a study in decision making and measuring success. I want to combine that with a thorough understanding of behavioral economics, human development and performance theory to build a tool that will help people overcome their own hurdles and win in their lives on the things that truly matter most.

Completing this bootcamp is just the first step on this journey and there is much more to learn and research to do before I can even begin developing anything of real value. But it is a step nonetheless and I'm taking it.

Of course, I have my fears and doubts but as I make my way through this course and learn all of that statistical & technical skills I remind myself that a scientist, at heart, is someone with a relentless pursuit of studying, testing and learning. And with a background of educational experience in several creative disciplines, including ballet & modern dance, interior design, web design, marketing & floral design, over my life I can say I've studied, tested & learned a lot.

It's not the typical background for a mathematically-based discipline but I'm not letting that stop me. What I want to put out there is way too important.
